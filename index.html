				<h2>Defining The Mind</h2>
				<p>
					The mind is a vast subject, and can be defined by many different parameters. Many things are considered, such as
					history, culture, general temperament, and, in some cases, when you were born or your placement among your siblings.
					It is a topic that is of some interest and peculiar fascination to me, so naturally I've put my findings and the data I've
					gathered from extensive informal research here, for your education and enjoyment. Let's Define The Mind together!
				</p>

					<dt><a href="1_aboutMBTI.html">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a></dt>
					<dd>
						Derived from Jungian personality theory, categorizes people into sixteen types, based on
						what data they gather and choose to utilize when interacting with the world.
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="3_aboutLove.html">The Five Love Languages</a></dt>
					<dd>
						Five parameters, which can be broken into two groups, are used to determine by what method you show love
						and affection, as well as how you best receive it.

				<h3>Parameters of Study</h3>
				<p>
					Different typology systems measure different aspects of the human experience. Therefore, it is erroneous to declare that one
					system is better or more accurate than another. Depending on what aspect of the mind you are defining, a certain typology system
					may be more or less suitable to your purposes. While certain tests or analyses of a system may not be accurate to what the system
					was meant to measure &lpar;some of these analyses can lead to typology being used as pseudoscience&rpar; it doesn&apos;t necessarily
					mean that the system itself is broken. It&apos;s just being used inaccurately.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not an astrologist. I have studied several practical typology systems, one of which is not generally thought of
					as a parameter by which to Define The Mind, but is nevertheless a fun and practical lens through which to view humanity.
					No person perfectly fits into any of these categories and therefore typology cannot be used as a way to predict a person&apos;s
					future or potential. It is simply a fun way to understand how different minds work and how we all relate to each other.
