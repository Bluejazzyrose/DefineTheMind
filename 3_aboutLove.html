				<h2>The Five Love Languages</h2>
				<p>
					The five love languages examine the unique ways an individual gives and receives love and affection.
					Which love language you utilize can have a lot to do with the atmosphere of your upbringing, as well
					as other determinants such as media influence, not to mention personal preference.

				<h3 id="langs">Words of Affirmation</h3>
				<p>
					You feel loved and encouraged by people&apos;s words.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Quality Time</h3>
				<p>
					You feel loved when you are with another person; not necessarily doing anything, but together.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Physical Touch</h3>
				<p>
					A gentle hand on your shoulder or a compassionate hug is how you feel connected with someone.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Gifts</h3>
				<p>
					It doesn&apos;t have to be big; just the fact that they found something and thought of you.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Acts of Service</h3>
				<p>
					Chivalry isn&apos;t dead! If they grab you a napkin, or hold the door for you, it touches your heart.
				</p>
				
				<p id="subcats">
					I have concurred that the Love Languages can be sorted into two catagories, based on how each displays
					and feels affection: Nearness, which includes quality time and physical touch, and Forethought, which
					includes words of affirmation, acts of service, and gifts. While everybody can utilize and feel loved
					when experiencing all the love languages, individuals usually have one or two that they are better at
					giving and prefer to receive; likewise, they can also sometimes have a language that they have a hard
					time receiving, as well as giving. For example, I myself express affection best through physical touch,
					followed closely by acts of service. However, I am not very good at receiving love in the form of gifts.
					It&apos;s meaningful to me; I just don&apos;t recognise that&apos;s what the person is trying to do when
					they offer to buy me something, or give me something they thought I would like, because I tend to be
					skeptical of this particular language.
