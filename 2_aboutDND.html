				<h2>Not Familiar With D&amp;D?</h2>
				<p>
					Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a classic roleplaying tabletop game enjoyed by a wide variety of
					people. It is the archtype and most well-known of its genre, though there are many others
					that follow in its footsteps. From partiers to strategists to storytellers, all have a place
					in the fantastical realm of heroes, faeries and elves, mythical beasts, and magic. Character
					design in roleplaying games is often intricate and nuanced, and D&amp;D is no exception! Because
					of this, D&amp;D stats and character design can be a very useful, though unorthodox, typology system.

				<p>
					As we discuss various aspects of character design and how it pertains to typology, you are highly
					encouraged to work through the character creation process and build a character sheet for the
					character you would be in a campaign. The steps will be laid out for you if you are unfamiliar with
					the process.
				</p>
				
				<h3>D&amp;D Stats &amp; The Real World</h3>
				<p id="sixstats">
					A player&apos;s character in D&amp;D has many traits and abilities that define them, and the
					most fundamental of these traits is the character&apos;s six primary stats, which measure the
					character&apos;s competence in different arenas of importance. Strength, constitution, and
					dexterity measure different aspects of the character&apos;s physical prowess, while intelligence,
					wisdom, and charisma focus more on their mental capacity and ability.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a typology system, D&amp;D stats are extremely helpful in understanding what skillset an individual is
					naturally gifted in, and ideally suited for improving performance by understanding how to play to your
					strengths in different situations. It can also be helpful in recognising where you are trying to use one
					stat when another may be much more effective. For the purposes of evaluating real people&mdash;and not
					fantasy heroes&mdash;the three stats that pertain to physical ability have been slightly altered so as to
					pertain to the mind in roughly the same dimensions as they pertained to the body.
				</p>
				
				<h4>The six core stats are detailed as follows:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Strength
						<p>
							The strength stat measures how persistent or committed a person is to their goal. Someone with a high
							strength stat will value having a good work ethic. They are strong-willed and do not give up when the
							going gets tough. This stat doesn&apos;t measure the ability of the person to complete their goal, but
							rather how long it will take them to forfeit.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Constitution
						<p>
							Constitution looks at the mental or emotional stability of a person. Someone with a high constitution
							stat is not easily fazed by insults, rudeness, or awkward situations. They are good at keeping their
							cool. Unlike strength, this stat measures the mental capacity of a person to complete their goal, rather
							than their will to do so.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Dexterity
						<p>
							Dexterity examines a person&apos;s mental reflexes, and how they respond to unexpected situations. Somebody
							with a good dexterity stat does not panic when things go awry, and is able to respond quickly and appropriately.
							Dexterity, unlike constitution, doesn&apos;t measure how affected they are by a situation, but rather how
							quickly they are able to recover.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Intelligence
						<p>
							The intelligence stat is pretty straightforward. People with a high intelligence stat value knowledge and often
							delight in collecting it. They often exercise having a good memory, and generally prefer not to speak into things
							they don&apos;t understand or know much about. Intelligence defers to concrete, collected data, which is what
							differentiates it from wisdom.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Wisdom
						<p>
							Wisdom, on the other hand, measures how perceptive a person is. Sarcasm and wit are the result of high wisdom paired
							with high charisma. Someone with a high wisdom stat will notice subtle deviations from the norm, such as a recent
							haircut or if someone is acting different than they usually do. Wisdom pairs well with dexterity as they can work
							together to cover up ignorance, or tactfully avoid an unideal situation.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Charisma
						<p>
							A high charisma stat will serve its user well. The charisma stat dictates a person&apos;s social awareness and ability
							to influence people in the way they are trying to. Darth Vadar has a high charisma stat, and is able to silence a room
							just by the way he walks in. The ability to command, manipulate, sway, or otherwise influence the judgement or actions
							of others is the mark of high charisma.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<div class="instruction">
					<h4>Creating a character - step 1</h4>
					<p>
						You can find a free character sheet template on the web without too much difficulty. For now, though, just get out a blank sheet
						of paper and jot down what your highest and lowest stats are. You can take the quiz to find out, or make an educated guess; you
						know yourself better than I do!
					</p>
					<p id="classes">
						The first step is assigning temporary stat values. We will add to some of these, which is why we&apos;re using a different paper
						for now. Using the value pairs listed below, assign a pair to each stat, putting higher values with stats you are more proficient
						in, and lower values for the stats that are less developed.
					</p>
					<ul class="center spacebetween">
						<li>&lpar; 8 / -1 &rpar;</li>
						<li>&lpar; 10 / 0 &rpar;</li>
						<li>&lpar; 12 / 1 &rpar;</li>
						<li>&lpar; 13 / 1 &rpar;</li>
						<li>&lpar; 14 / 2 &rpar;</li>
						<li>&lpar; 15 / 2 &rpar;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Classes &amp; Subclasses</h3>
				<p>
					While a character&apos;s core stats represent their innate skillset, the character&apos;s class represents the
					expression of these innate strengths and weaknesses. A well-chosen class utilizes the character&apos;s best stats
					to optimize their performance. Warriors are usually built from characters with high strength, dexterity, and constitution,
					whereas mages and characters built for out-of-combat utility often sport intelligence, wisdom, or charisma. Your
					character&apos;s class should reflect which stats you are most developed in, as well as your general disposition
					toward life.
				</p>

					<h4 id="races">Creating a character - step 2</h4>
					<p>
						Taking into consideration the primary stats &lpar;as well as the general attitude and tone&rpar; of
						each class, choose a class that you think would most accurately represent your ideals and worldview.
						If you are familiar with D&amp;D and the character creation process, you might consider multiclassing.
						If your top stat is <span style="color:#3AB54A">constitution</span> or <span style="color:#3AB54A">intelligence</span>,
						you may not resonate with any class that shares your top stat. In such cases, you might choose a class
						based in your second or even third most developed stats.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based on the class you choose, your character will have certain characteristics and skills. These are
						detailed under the description for each class, listed above. You will want to make a note of which hit
						die, proficiencies, equipment, etc. your character will start with because of their class.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Races &amp; Subraces</h3>
				<p>
					The race you choose for your character will give them a myriad of natural skills and gifts, appropriate for the
					culture and surroundings in which they grew up. There are many playable races in D&amp;D, but for the sake of creating
					a character alike to its creator we will only be considering the common varieties, as well as some half-human varients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many races have a set of subraces, which inherit traits from the parent race but with unique and subtle differences. A wood
					elf has different experience from a drow who is a being of the silent night. A dwarf of the hills may have different skills
					than the dwarf who builds ornate mountain structures. As such, you may need to choose an appropriate subrace as well.
				</p>
				
				<h4>The basic and human-hybrid races in D&amp;D are detailed as follows:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Elves
						<p>
							Elves are fair and graceful. Whether they are ruddy with skin tinged green, or pale like the moon with dark hair, or black
							as charcoal with a wild white mane and glinting eyes&mdash;elves appear otherworldly and whimsical to the outside world. They
							value knowledge and beauty, whatever that may mean to them. They tend to clash with the dwarves, though there are some recorded
							instances of elves and dwarves being companions and traveling the world together.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Dwarves
						<p>
							Dwarves are hardworking and clever. Often craftsmen, they take pride in the work of their hands, and glory in building grand halls
							and castles. They tend to prefer working with stone, metals, and gemstones, which brings them to gravitate towards towering mountain
							ridges and rolling hills, which are more likely to contain their crafting medium of choice. Dwarves are stubborn and proud, but also
							unfailingly loyal to their people and their cause, if they have one.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Halflings
						<p>
							Known by the rest of the world as the little people, halflings never grow to be larger than a human child. They are generally friendly
							and hospitable, and appreciate life&apos;s simple pleasures. A cozy home, a lush garden, and a mug of good ale are the things they work
							every day to achieve, and they are often content with a comfortable, maybe mundane, life. Many halflings feel the quiet tug of wanderlust,
							though few ever pursue their avid curiosity with any real fervor.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Humans
						<p>
							Humans are widespread and varied in the world of D&amp;D. They are the understood &apos;other half&apos; of the many cases of mixed races.
							Humans are vigilant, often entertaining lofty aspirations that, for such a short-lived race, would seem unrealistic. However, they often
							surprise others with their ability to conquer and overcome even the greatest of challenges. Their unique ability to adapt and their dedication
							to their goals often scares the other races, but also leaves them with a certain amount of respect for this transient people.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many subtypes of humans, mostly half-breeds with one parent being human and one belonging to a different race. For our intents and
							purposes, we will only be examining these hybrids, as they have more unique characteristics that will add interest to your character.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<div class="instruction">
					<h4 id="backgrounds">Creating a character - step 3</h4>
					<p>
						Choose a race and subrace that you feel aligns with your personality and behavior. Based on the race you choose, you will gain unique proficiencies,
						abilities, and skills. Some races start with a simple spell or supernatural ability. Record the characteristics you gain through the race you chose,
						namely modifications to stats, racial features and abilities, and any proficiencies or languages. Some information is not recorded yet, so check back soon!
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Backgrounds &amp; Feats</h3>
				<p>
					Backgrounds and feats add an extra depth and fullness to your character. Like racial traits, backgrounds are skills and equipment that your character is
					likely to have based on their upbringings or their former trade. Feats usually are modifications to your skillset based on your gathered experience,
					which in this case would be life in general. For our psychology purposes, I&apos;ve modified the feats to correspond to learned behavioral patterns that
					you may exhibit, though in the game they would be more geared toward combat and utility skills that you might pick up on your journey.
