				<h2>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
				<p>
					Derived from personality theories developed by Carl Jung, the Myers-Briggs Type
					Indicator &lpar;commonly abbreviated as MBTI&rpar; uses four guiding factors to
					categorize people into sixteen types, based on how they process and interact with
					the world around them. Although it uses the words introverted and extraverted,
					the terminology can be somewhat misleading, since this typology system actually
					<i>doesn't</i> measure the social energy levels of a person. Likewise, the P for
					Perceiving and the J for Judging don't directly affect how organized an individual
					is; instead, they point to which set of functions the individual prefers to use.
					Basically, the first and fourth letters in a person&apos;s type acronym assist in
					the interpretation of the middle two letters. Confused? Don't worry&mdash;we will
					be exploring some aspects of this nuanced typology system together.

				<h3 id="sixteentypes">The Sixteen Types</h3>
				<p>
					Here is provided a summary of each of the 16 personality types, as defined by MBTI.
					While it seemed appropriate to put this information at the top, the details and nuance
					of the individual types with their unique functions will become a lot clearer to you
					if you understand the concepts discussed in the next three sections. Therefore, if you
					are relatively new to MBTI, I highly recommend checking out the other sections first
					and coming back to this one.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>ESFJ: the Hostess
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Fe&ensp;|&ensp;Si&ensp;|&ensp;Ne&ensp;|&ensp;Ti</span><br>
						ESFJs generally have a very active social life and are masters at influencing those within their
						social sphere. Stereotypically, they often play the role of Queen Bee, and enjoy organizing parties,
						socializing at a potluck, and taking care to make sure others are enjoying themselves too. Regina
						George from the film <i>Mean Girls</i> is an ESFJ, as is Snow White from the 1937 Disney classic. Both are
						keenly aware of the social environment around them and seek to influence it to their liking &lpar;for
						better or for worse&rpar;. When Snow White becomes aquainted with the dwarves, she steps right up to
						the task of cleaning up their home and organizing their lives for their good and ease of mind, though
						they don&apos;t appreciate her intrusion at first. Generally, the ESFJ is not so much concerned with
						improving the social norm as they are with maintaining it to their particular standards.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>ISFJ: the Caretaker
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Si&ensp;|&ensp;Fe&ensp;|&ensp;Ti&ensp;|&ensp;Ne</span><br>
						ISFJs are often thought of as the perfect sidekick. They are loyal to their people, sometimes to a
						fault, and take great care to maintain a safe, positive environment for themselves and those around
						them. Like ESFJs, their emphasis is usually on maintenance, not improvement. However, unlike their
						extraverted counterparts, ISFJs generally don&apos;t look to influence the social environment
						directly; they tend to work from behind the scenes, from the kitchen or socializing in small groups
						at a time. Samwise Gamgee from J. R. R. Tolkien&apos;s epic series <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is a
						perfect example of an ISFJ. He is totally faithful to his friend Frodo, and does everything in his
						power to make his burden easier to bear; he also strongly dislikes Gollum for his grubby, sneaky,
						sometimes abrasive mannerisms and sees him as a threat to Frodo&apos;s well-being. Another good example
						of an ISFJ is Wendy Darling from the 1953 Disney film <i>Peter Pan</i>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>ESTJ: the Manager
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Te&ensp;|&ensp;Si&ensp;|&ensp;Ne&ensp;|&ensp;Fi</span><br>
						ESTJs are very business-oriented and do not like wasting time. They are quick decision-makers and
						excel at organizing their time and getting things done. Sokka from the animated show <i>Avatar: the Last
						Airbender</i>, is a prime example of an ESTJ in action. He has quick reflexes, is clever, and often has a
						very set way he likes to do things. Another great example of an ESTJ is Hermoine Granger from J. K.
						Rowling&apos;s popular book series, <i>Harry Potter</i>. Hermoine is very driven to do well academically,
						and while she has something of a know-it-all attitude, it is for grounded reasons, since she is quite
						often right on the subject. ESTJs are good at taking charge in a work or school project; while they
						might not delegate as well as an <b>Fe</b> user would, they will make sure everything gets done in a
						satisfactory manner well before the deadline hits.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>ISTJ: the Librarian
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Si&ensp;|&ensp;Te&ensp;|&ensp;Fi&ensp;|&ensp;Ne</span><br>
						ISTJs value details and are known for being meticulous and a bit rigid in their routines. They are
						sensible and value a good work ethic, but they tend to focus more on doing things &apos;the right
						way&apos; rather than focusing on efficiency, which is what differentiates them from their extraverted
						counterparts. Old Carl Fredricksen from the Pixar film <i>Up</i> exemplifies this type well. He is most
						comfortable when he has a set routine to follow, and he has a particular place or process for
						everything within his jurisdiction. Another great example of an ISTJ is Cogsworth from the 1991 Disney
						classic <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. He oversees the household with great care to detail, and gets
						upset when Lumiere acts impulsively without following protocol. ISTJs are sometimes labeled by the MBTI
						community as the backbone of society; they are often the ones behind the scenes making sure everything
						is done properly and with excellence.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>ENFJ: the Therapist
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Fe&ensp;|&ensp;Ni&ensp;|&ensp;Se&ensp;|&ensp;Ti</span><br>
						ENFJs are experts at influencing their social environment, and unlike the ESFJs, their focus tends to
						be more future-oriented, with an emphasis on improvement and growth. They strive to better themselves
						and those around them for the good of the group. Sometimes this mindset can backfire, as it does with
						Jane Austin&apos;s character Emma. Emma wants to find the perfect match for her friend, but she
						assumes that she knows what her friend wants and needs when in fact she does not. Joy from the Pixar
						film <i>Inside Out</i> has a similar character arc, and is also a good example of an ENFJ. Joy is in
						tune with Riley&apos;s thoughts, but doesn&apos;t realize until the end of the film that the methods
						she was using to fix her were actually ineffective. Once she switched gears and let go of some of her
						control, she was able to help those around her grow in their understanding of themselves and respect
						for each other, which was what Riley needed.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>INFJ: the Champion
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Ni&ensp;|&ensp;Fe&ensp;|&ensp;Ti&ensp;|&ensp;Se</span><br>
						INFJs value details and are known for being meticulous and a bit rigid in their routines.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>ENTJ: the Entrepeneur
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Te&ensp;|&ensp;Ni&ensp;|&ensp;Se&ensp;|&ensp;Fi</span><br>
						ENTJs sometimes put people off with their relentless ambition. However, this is one of their greatest
						strengths. ENTJs love action, and are tireless in striving toward their goal. They regard the present
						in light of the future, which shows in the fact that they seldom waste time on things that will not
						benefit them in the long run. While ESTJs are effective, ENTJs are efficient. Azula from <i>Avatar:
						the Last Airbender</i> is the perfect example of an ENTJ, albeit an evil one. She is very ambitious,
						assertive to her peers, and keeps the future in perspective when she makes decisions. A less evil
						example of this personality type is Princess Leia from the classic film trilogy <i>Star Wars</i>.
						She shares many of the same traits with Azula, but with a future in mind that benefits others and
						not just herself. She is sometimes harsh towards her peers and commanders, but this is because she
						expects great things from them.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>INTJ: the Visionary
						<p>
						<span style="color:#3AB54A">Function Stack: Ni&ensp;|&ensp;Te&ensp;|&ensp;Fi&ensp;|&ensp;Se</span><br>
						INTJs value details and are known for being meticulous and a bit rigid in their routines.
